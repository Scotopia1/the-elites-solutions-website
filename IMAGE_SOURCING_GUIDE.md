## Color Theme Considerations

Your website uses a **dark theme with gold accents**. Choose images that:
- Have dark backgrounds (black, dark gray, navy)
- Feature warm lighting or gold/amber tones
- Show technology/screens in dark mode
- Avoid overly bright or pastel colors

### Best Image Styles for Your Brand:
- Dark mode UI screenshots
- Low-key lighting photography
- Moody tech atmospheres
- Minimalist workspaces with accent lighting

## Next Steps

1. Visit the links above and download images that match your brand
2. Rename files according to the suggested naming convention
3. Optimize images before adding to `/public/images/`
4. Update JSON files in `/src/data/` to reference new image paths
